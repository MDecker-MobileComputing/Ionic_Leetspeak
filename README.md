# Leetspeak #

Simple Ionic app with Angular, to demonstrate how an Ionic app can be
packaged into an [Electron app](https://www.electronjs.org/).
The function of the app is it to translate the text provided by the user
to [Leetspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet), which is realized by simple letter substitutions.

**Example:**
* Input: *"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."*
* Output: *"Th3 qu1ck 8r0wn f0x jump5 0v3r th3 142y d09."*
